# CodeSense Copilot Autocomplete Engine

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

**CodeSense Copilot** is an **AI-powered**, console-based autocomplete engine meticulously crafted to revolutionize coding efficiency. Leveraging a robust Trie data structure, sophisticated fuzzy matching algorithms, and adaptive, dynamic frequency-based ranking, it delivers **predictive, intuitively context-aware, and exceptionally relevant** code completion, empowering developers with intelligent, real-time assistance directly within the command line.

This project goes beyond basic autocompletion, offering a rich interactive experience with syntax highlighting and smart input handling, aiming to provide a powerful development environment even in a console setting.

## Features

* **Intelligent Autocomplete:**
    * **Fuzzy Matching and Typo Tolerance:** Employs a sophisticated recursive **edit-distance algorithm** (e.g., Levenshtein distance) to identify the closest dictionary matches, even with typo errors or parial input. 
    * **Adaptive Learning & Personalization:** Prioritizes frequently used words and learned selections, making suggestions more relevant and adapting to user's coding patterns.
    * **Prefix-Awareness:** Quickly narrows down suggestions based on the current word's prefix.
    * **Balanced Scoring for Relevance:** A custom scoring algorithm intelligently combines the word's learned frequency with its edit distance from the input ensuring that suggestions are optimally ranked, prioritizing highly relevant and frequently used terms while still offering accurate matches even with minor discrepancies.
    * **Dictionary security**: Persistent dictionary that saves learned word frequencies.
* **Systems Programming:**
    * **Direct Console Interaction:** Leverages **Windows API functions** (`<windows.h>`, `_getch()`) for direct manipulation of the console buffer, enabling immediate and highly responsive user feedback.
    * **Low-Level Console Control:** Implements precise cursor positioning and manipulation, providing fine-grained control over the console display for an enhanced text editing experience.
    * **Real-time Character-by-Character Input:** Processes input in real-time, handling each character individually for instantaneous response and dynamic display updates without buffering delays.
    * **Efficient Memory Management:** Manages memory for persistent data structure.
* **Compiler/Language Theory:**
    * Built-in lexer/tokenizer intelligently categorizes input into various token types (keywords, comments, strings, numbers, operators, punctuation, preprocessor directives).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

At its core, CodeSense Copilot combines several advanced algorithms and system-level interactions:

### 1. Trie Data Structure
The backbone of the autocomplete engine is a highly optimized **Trie (prefix tree)**. Each node in the Trie stores whether it marks the end of a valid word and, critically, a `frequency` count.
* **`Trie::insert(word, freq)`**: Efficiently adds words to the dictionary, initializing or updating their frequency.
* **`Trie::log_selection(word)`**: Dynamically increases the frequency of a word (by `5` units per selection) whenever it's auto-completed or explicitly confirmed by the user, making the engine adapt and learn.

### 2. Advanced Fuzzy Matching
For suggestions beyond exact prefixes, the engine employs a recursive **fuzzy matching** algorithm (a variant of Levenshtein distance).
* **`Trie::search_fuzzy(...)`**: This method intelligently explores the Trie, simulating various edit operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to find words within a specified `max_edits` threshold from the user's input. It meticulously tracks the `edits_used` to determine match quality.

### 3. Intelligent Ranking (`FuzzyMatch` & Scoring)
The system prioritizes the most relevant suggestions through a custom scoring mechanism:
* The `FuzzyMatch` struct holds the `word`, its `frequency`, and the `edit_distance` from the input.
* The `get_ranked_fuzzy_matches` function calculates a `score` for each match (e.g., `score = frequency - alpha * edit_distance`), where `alpha` can be tuned to balance the importance of frequency versus exactness.
* A custom `operator<` for `FuzzyMatch` prioritizes exact matches (edit distance 0), then sorts by the calculated `score` (descending), and finally by word lexicographically (ascending) for ties.

### 4. Lexical Analysis (Tokenizer)
The `MainLogicController::tokenize` function acts as a **basic lexer**, breaking down the input line into distinct **tokens** (e.g., `KEYWORD`, `STRING_LITERAL`, `COMMENT`, `OPERATOR`, `PUNCTUATION`, etc.). This enables the console to render text with appropriate syntax highlighting.

### 5. Real-time Console I/O
The `MainLogicController::interactive_loop` uses direct Windows API calls (`GetStdHandle`, `SetConsoleCursorPosition`, `_getch()`) to provide a responsive, character-by-character editing experience. This allows for:
* Instantaneous character input capture.
* Precise cursor positioning.
* Dynamic redrawing of the input line with syntax coloring.
* Automatic handling of indentation and basic auto-closing characters, enhancing the developer's experience.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* **Advanced Contextual Awareness:** Implement a more robust parser to understand C++ syntax and provide truly semantic suggestions (e.g., class members after `.` or `->`).
* **Multi-line Editing:** Extend the console editor to support navigation and editing across multiple lines.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Adapt the console rendering logic to work on Linux/macOS using libraries like NCurses or similar.
* **Configurable Settings:** Allow users to customize `max_edits`, `alpha` values, and highlighting colors.
* **Dynamic Keyword Loading:** Load keywords from external files or C++ standard libraries.
